# The Collaboration of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Credit Risk Prediction

This project is the final project of the virtual internship experience of ID/X Partners x Rakamin Academy. The objective of this project is to create a credit risk classification of a banking data. The original task of the final project does not involve clustering (unsupervised learning) in the process. However, to take the project up a notch, clustering was performed to determine the suitable number of classes for the data given.
